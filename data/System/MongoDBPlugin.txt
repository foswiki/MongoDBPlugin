---++ Usage
This is an experimental attempt to utilise [[http://mongodb.org][MongoDB]] for all aspects of serialisation in foswiki.

At this point the Plugin is used to populate the MongoDB. All user topic Saves are automatically copied into the MongoDB, and you can batch load using the restHandler:
   * %SCRIPTURL{rest}%/MongoDBPlugin/update?updateweb=Main

---++ Technical details
This initial version serialises the internal Meta object directly into _one_ collection, using web.name as a unique index.

It was written for an older version of MongoDB, which did not support the =OR= operator, so uses regex's to implement =OR=.

In the process shoing a proof of concept that works (so long as each of your topics (as stored internally in the Meta obj) are all smaller than 4M.
